## Understanding Complex Information-Processing Systems
Three levels of embodiment:
- Computational theory: What is the goal? why it is appropriate? what is the logic?
- Representation and algorithm: How the theory is implemented? what is the representation of input and output?
- Hardware implementation: how can representation and algorithm be realized physically?

Different levels turned out to be loosely related, that some phenomena may only be explained at one/two level (e.g. human's mind serial vs. machine parallel; understanding perception vs understanding neurons; learning aerodynamics vs learning bird flight).

- Mind: mental level
- Brain: physical level

## Representation vs. Understanding
Rules can be flexible.
- "If animal eats meat, it is not herbivore." - A deer eating rabbit?
- “No vehicles allowed in the park" - ambulance?

### The Bitter Lesson
Rich Sutton

General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective - not human knowledge.
e.g., edge detection, SIFT features outperformed by dnn with scalable convolution in CV tasks.

### Expertise in Real World Contexts
Hubert L. Dreyfus and Stuart E. Dreyfus

> The matters that set experts apart from ... beginners, are symbolic, inferential, and
rooted in experiential knowledge. ... Experts build up a repertory of working rules of
thumb, or “heuristics,” that, combined with book knowledge, make them expert
practitioners.
